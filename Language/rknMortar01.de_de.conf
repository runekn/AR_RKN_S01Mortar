  "You crew a mortar and has been stationed on a hill outpost. The outpost is not yet finished, and your officer is on his way from the nearby camp with the shell ammunition."
  "The Cold War has gone lukewarm. Proxy wars has slowly turned into small scale direct conflict between the nuclear powers in remote third-world countries."\
  "The island of Everon is eyed by the USSR, and its Government has invited a small US force to build a camp there to encourage the soviet's better judgement. "\
  "Though the token force is small, as there is little interest in pulling from more important fronts to this ocean rock."
  "When requested a firemission, the requester will first provide the target location. This can be in the form of "\
  " - Grid: Corrdinates as refereced on your map"\
  " - Polar: Bearing from requester's position. Requires knowing the requester's position."\
  " - Shift from known point: Some distance away from a named location on your map."\
  ""\
  "Another piece of info is whether the requester want you to strike the target with effect (5 shells) right away, called \"Fire for effect\", or act as observer and guide you unto target. This is called \"Adjust fire\". "\
  "  Additional information may also be given including shell type, and recommended impact trajectory angle (based on surrounding terrain)."\
  ""\
  "<b>Adjust fire</b>"\
  "During adjustment phase, the observer will expect one shell at a time. Upon impact the observer will give corrections. These correction are usually based on the observer's reference."\
  ""\
  "Examples "\
  " - \"Drop 300 meters, left 50 meters\": target 300 meters closer to the observer, and 50 meters to his left."\
  " - \"Add 100 meters\": target 100 meters further away from the observer."\
  ""\
  "Though keep an ear to how the observer gives the correction, since NATO is stretched thin and correct procedures may not have been trained."\
  "  In case the initial target location info did not yield the position of the observer, and adjustments are called in a polar manner, then the adjustments will be preceded by the bearing from observer to target."\
  "  Once a shell has found the target during adjustment, the observer will call \"Fire for effect\", after which 5 shells are expected with no further adjustments."
